    <h1>About Coffee Co.</h1>
    <p>Coffee Co. was established in Cape Town, Observatory, South Africa, in March 2022. What started as a humble venture selling only coffee beans imported from Ethiopia, some of the finest in the continent, quickly evolved into something much bigger.</p>
    <p>In May 2023, we opened our first coffee shop, and in that short space of time, our establishment has transformed from a small shop to a well-known hotspot where professionals come to work, friends gather to enjoy a cup and a sandwich, and families reunite with their loved ones.</p>
    <p>Our place has become an attraction hotspot, bustling with energy and warmth. We are grateful to the lovely people of Cape Town for their unwavering support, and we are committed to continuing to serve the best cup of coffee and delicious bites.</p>
    <p>Come join us in our journey, and experience the magic of Coffee Co.!</p>
